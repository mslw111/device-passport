The agent also acknowledged the GDPR flags, but concluded that they do not significantly affect the overall risk level. However, the agent's risk rating does not match the 'Medium' risk rating provided in its summary, which is a discrepancy.\n\n2. GDPR Agent: This agent reported an error (LLM ERROR: 404 models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta), which might have affected its evaluation. Despite the error, the agent still provides a 'Medium' risk rating and identifies a 'Non-Compliant' GDPR status due to active tokens found without erasure. It's unclear how the agent arrived at this conclusion given the error reported.\n\n3. Sensor Agent: The agent provides a detailed narrative, correctly noting the presence of account tokens and missing sensor data as high-risk factors. However, there is an inconsistency between the agent's risk rating (Low) in the summary and the 'High Risk' mentioned in the narrative section. The uncertainty level is also not in line with the narrative, which mentions 'High' uncertainty due to missing sensor data, but reports a low 0.2 uncertainty level in the summary.",

This agent has also noted the potential GDPR concerns due to the presence of account tokens without GDPR erasure. However, there is a contradiction between the text and the risk rating. The agent mentions that the overall risk is low, but the risk rating is marked as 'Medium'. Also, the uncertainty value seems quite high without a clear reason given in the text.\n\n2. GDPR: This agent has not provided any substantive output. Instead, it has returned an error message indicating that the model used for analysis is not found. Therefore, it's not contributing to the risk assessment. The risk rating and uncertainty values appear to be arbitrary as there's no explanatory text to support them.\n\n3. Sensor: The agent provides a clear narrative of the device's status, mentioning the good condition of the battery, the intact screen, the GDPR concerns, and the missing sensor data. However, there is a discrepancy between the narrative risk rating and the actual risk rating provided. The narrative states the device as 'High Risk', but the actual risk rating is marked as 'Low'. Also, the uncertainty level mentioned in the narrative does not match with the uncertainty value provided. \n\nIn summary, all agents have inconsistencies between their narratives and the risk and uncertainty values they provide.
